South Africa GUIDING QUESTION How did Mandela contribute to the end of apartheid? In South Africa, whites dominated the political system. Blacks began organizing against white rule and formed the African National Congress (ANC) in 1912. Its goal of economic and political reform was met with little initial success. Apartheid By the 1950s, South African whites (descendants of the Dutch, known as Afrikaners) had strengthened the laws separating whites and blacks. The result was a system of racial segregation and discrimination known as apartheid (“apartness”). Blacks demonstrated against these laws, but were brutally repressed by the white government. In 1960 police opened fire on people who were leading a peaceful march in Sharpeville, killing 69 marchers, two-thirds of whom were shot in the back. After the arrest of ANC leader Nelson Mandela in 1962, members of the organization called for armed resistance to the white government. On June 12, 1964, the South African court sentenced Mandela to life in prison for sabotage and conspiracy against the government. He narrowly escaped the death penalty.

In Latin America, most nations had achieved their independence in the 1800s, so the struggles for independence in the twentieth century were also internal, with the poor working classes fighting to gain representation and rights from the elites, made up of church officials, landowners, and military leaders who controlled their countries and kept the wealth. These elites were often supported by an outside power stretching its own colonialist muscles: the United States. The United States embraced its new identity as a superpower. In many nations, particularly in Latin America, U.S. leaders began to interfere more and more with internal politics to gain advantages economically and politically.

So images and symbols were frequently used instead of printed words to communicate important ideas. The painting by Le Barbier (Fig. 8) uses many such symbols to convey the content of the Declaration of Rights. Let us try to read these symbols. Snake biting its tail to form a ring: Symbol of Eternity . A ring has neither beginning nor end.Sceptre : Symbol of royal power .The eye within a triangle radiating light : The all- seeing eye stands for knowledge. The rays of the sun will drive away the clouds of ignorance.The bundle of rods or fasces : One rod can be easily broken, but not an entire bundle.

A new constitution was introduced which denied the vote to non-propertied sections of society. It provided for two elected legislative councils. These then appointed a Directory, an executive made up of five members. This was meant as a safeguard against the concentration of power in a one-man executive as under the Jacobins. However, the Directors often clashed with the legislative councils, who then sought to dismiss them. The political instability of the Directory paved the way for the rise of a military dictator, Napoleon Bonaparte.

However, their grievances and demands were listed in some 40,000 letters which the representatives had brought with them. Voting in the Estates General in the past had been conducted according to the principle that each estate had one vote. This time too Louis XVI was determined to continue the same practice. But members of the third estate demanded that voting now be conducted by the assembly as a whole, where each member would have one vote. This was one of the democratic principles put forward by philosophers like Rousseau in his book The Social Contract . When the king rejected this proposal, members of the third estate walked out of the assembly in protest. The representatives of the third estate viewed themselves as spokesmen for the whole French nation. On 20 June they assembled in the hall of an indoor tennis court in the grounds of Versailles.
